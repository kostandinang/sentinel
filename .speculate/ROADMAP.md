# Sentinel Platform Advancement Roadmap

**Version:** 1.0 → 2.0
**Status:** Planning Phase
**Generated:** 2025-11-02

## Vision

Transform Sentinel from a Claude Code monitoring tool into a comprehensive, extensible AI agent monitoring platform that supports multiple agent types, provides rich analytics, and integrates seamlessly with developer workflows.

## Enhancement Categories

Based on the README "Future Enhancements" section and project philosophy, we've identified 8 major enhancement categories:

### 1. Multi-Agent Support (CRITICAL)
Extend beyond Claude Code to support multiple AI agents (Cursor, GitHub Copilot, etc.)

### 2. Data Export & Analytics (HIGH)
Export session data in multiple formats and provide usage analytics

### 3. Advanced UI/UX Features (HIGH)
Mini mode, keyboard shortcuts, and improved user experience

### 4. Customization & Theming (MEDIUM)
Custom icon themes and visual customization options

### 5. Performance & Reliability (CRITICAL)
Production hardening, error recovery, and performance optimization

### 6. Developer Integrations (MEDIUM)
Integration with IDEs, build tools, and other developer utilities

### 7. Advanced Monitoring (HIGH)
Resource usage tracking, performance metrics, and diagnostics

### 8. Testing & Quality (CRITICAL)
Comprehensive test coverage, CI/CD, and quality assurance

## Total Effort Estimate

- **Phase 1 (Foundation):** ~40 hours (2 weeks)
- **Phase 2 (Core Features):** ~60 hours (3 weeks)
- **Phase 3 (Advanced Features):** ~50 hours (2.5 weeks)
- **Phase 4 (Polish & Ship):** ~30 hours (1.5 weeks)

**Total: ~180 hours (9 weeks at 20 hours/week)**

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Support 3+ agent types (Claude, Cursor, Copilot)
- ✅ < 1 second launch time with 100+ sessions in history
- ✅ Zero crashes in 1 month of continuous operation
- ✅ 90%+ code coverage with automated tests
- ✅ Positive feedback from 50+ beta users
- ✅ Extensible plugin architecture for future agents

## Next Steps

1. Review detailed task graphs for each category
2. Prioritize based on user feedback and strategic goals
3. Begin with Phase 1 foundation work
4. Establish CI/CD pipeline early
5. Recruit beta testers for feedback loop
